# Homelab-Dashboard
A Simple dashboard for your homelab using bootstrap. Inspired by a post at /r/selfhosted. It's free to use and you can modify it, just don't sell it.
It's pretty simple just put it in your web server's public html folder. It simply runs with Bootstrap and HTML. All you need to do is add
your own links and titles. You can change or add glyphicons using i class and then the glyphicon, you can find a list of glyphicons with previews here: https://getbootstrap.com/components/
